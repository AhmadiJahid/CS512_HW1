In this notebook, we explored the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset using two fundamental classification techniques: **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** and **Decision Trees**. We performed the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Splitting:**
    - Loaded the dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`.
    - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Visualized class distribution.
    - Analyzed the first 5 features using pairplots and correlation matrices.
    - Displayed summary statistics for the first 5 features, grouped by class.

3. **Preprocessing:**
    - Standardized the feature values using `StandardScaler`.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Trained kNN and Decision Tree classifiers using default parameters.
    - Evaluated both classifiers on the validation set using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    - Tuned `n_neighbors` for kNN and `max_depth` for Decision Tree.
    - Plotted validation accuracy against hyperparameters.

6. **Feature Importance:**
    - Visualized feature importance for the Decision Tree classifier.

7. **Test Set Evaluation:**
    - Evaluated the best models on the test set using various metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and AUC score.
    - Plotted the ROC curve for the positive class (malignant).

### Analysis

- **Performance Comparison:**
    - Both classifiers performed well, but kNN slightly outperformed the Decision Tree in terms of accuracy and F1-score on the test set.
    - kNN achieved a test accuracy of 98.84% and an F1-score of 99.17%.
    - Decision Tree achieved a test accuracy of 95.35% and an F1-score of 96.61%.

- **Impact of Hyperparameters:**
    - For kNN, increasing `n_neighbors` generally improved validation accuracy up to a point, after which it plateaued.
    - For Decision Tree, increasing `max_depth` initially improved validation accuracy, but deeper trees did not significantly enhance performance and could lead to overfitting.

- **Overall Performance:**
    - kNN performed better overall due to its higher accuracy and F1-score.
    - Decision Tree provided valuable insights into feature importance, highlighting the most influential features in the dataset.

### Summary

This notebook demonstrated the application of kNN and Decision Tree classifiers on a real-world dataset, showcasing the importance of data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. The insights gained from feature importance analysis further enhanced our understanding of the dataset.
